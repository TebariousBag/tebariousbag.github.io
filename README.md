# Atlas-Web-Development
# CSS Advanced (Max's Version)

## Overview:
In this project we take the HTML from our previous project and apply CSS to style it. We are working off a Figma file and trying to replicate it as closely as possible, with the goal for it to be near pixel perfect.

## Summary:
I enjoyed this project and I feel like I learned a lot from it.

### Figma
It took ahile to kinda figure out how to use Figma, but once I started to figure it out it was really helpful. I plan on learning more in the future.

### CSS
There is so much to learn from CSS, I think I managed to get it to look the way it's supposed to, but the .css file is very ugly. And there are probably simpler ways to do it. But I'm still learning and I'm sure I'll find simpler methods to get the job done.

## Conclusion:
Overall I learned a lot and want to continue learning more. I definitely need to spend more time with flex-box.
